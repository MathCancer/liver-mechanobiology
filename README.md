# liver tissue mechanobiology
The model simulates the liver tissue mechanobiology (liver parenchyma-tumor interaction). The liver tissue is elastic-plastic: **Elastic**: on short times, when itâ€™s deformed it elastically tries to return to its rest position and imparts forces on nearby tumor cells; **Plastic**: on long times, the resting position of these tissue elements relaxes back to the current position. We want to explore how tissue-tumor interaction affects the invasive growth of tumor.

## Release summary: 
### 0.1.0:
This is initial release. In this version, we explore the random metastasis of tumor within liver tissue. Tumor cells are
stochastically seeded through the tissue, using a constant of probability of seeding per voxel.
